The team's historical stadium is Cairo International Stadium, although matches are sometimes played at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria.
The national football team of Egypt is the most successful team in the Africa Cup of Nations, having won the Tournament a record seven times, including the inaugural edition in 1957. Egypt is also considered one of Africa's powerhouses, being one of three teams in the continent that has reached the top 10.
In the international stage, Egypt has so far made only three appearances in the World Cup (in 1934, 1990 and 2018). Egypt was the first team outside the Americas and Europe to participate in the World Cup. They also hold the record for the longest gap between two appearances, and the oldest player to have ever played at the World Cup. Egypt is also the only national team that has a perfect winning record against Germany.
